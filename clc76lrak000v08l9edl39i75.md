# OpenTelemetry + Splunk : A perfect match

### Introduction:

OpenTelemetry is an open-source, vendor-neutral observability platform that enables you to collect, process, and export telemetry data from your applications and infrastructure. The goal of OpenTelemetry is to provide a standard, flexible, and vendor-neutral way to instrument and observe your software, making it easier to understand the behavior and performance of your applications in production.

In this blog post, we'll explore how you can use OpenTelemetry with Splunk to monitor and troubleshoot your applications. We'll start by discussing the basics of OpenTelemetry and how it compares to other observability platforms. Then, we'll dive into how to instrument your applications with OpenTelemetry, and how to export and analyze the data with Splunk.

### What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, libraries, and tools that allow you to instrument your applications and infrastructure with telemetry data. Telemetry data is any data that is generated by your applications or infrastructure and used to understand their behavior and performance.

OpenTelemetry provides a standard way to instrument your applications, regardless of the language or framework you're using. It also provides a standard way to collect, process, and export this telemetry data, making it easier to integrate with a variety of observability tools.

OpenTelemetry is based on the OpenTracing standard, which was developed by a consortium of companies to provide a vendor-neutral way to instrument distributed systems. OpenTelemetry extends the OpenTracing standard to support a broader range of observability use cases, including metrics, logs, and distributed tracing.

OpenTelemetry vs. Other Observability Platforms:

There are several other observability platforms available, such as Prometheus, Datadog, and New Relic. While these platforms are all useful for monitoring and troubleshooting your applications, they each have their own proprietary APIs and data formats. This can make it difficult to switch between observability tools or to integrate them with your existing monitoring and logging infrastructure.

OpenTelemetry aims to solve this problem by providing a standard, vendor-neutral way to instrument and observe your software. This means that you can use OpenTelemetry to instrument your applications, and then export the telemetry data to the observability tool of your choice. This flexibility makes it easier to choose the right observability tool for your needs, without being locked into a particular vendor or platform.

### Instrumenting Your Applications with OpenTelemetry:

Now that we've discussed the basics of OpenTelemetry, let's take a look at how you can use it to instrument your applications. OpenTelemetry provides libraries and APIs for a wide range of programming languages, including Java, Python, Go, and .NET.

To instrument your application with OpenTelemetry, you'll need to install the OpenTelemetry library for your programming language and then add code to your application to emit telemetry data. The process will vary depending on the language and framework you're using, but here's a general overview of the steps involved:

1. Install the OpenTelemetry library: The first step is to install the OpenTelemetry library for your programming language. This library provides the APIs and tools you'll need to instrument your application.
    
2. Create a tracer: A tracer is an object that is responsible for generating and managing trace data. To create a tracer, you'll need to import the OpenTelemetry library and then use the tracer factory to create a new tracer.
    
3. Instrument your code: Once you have a tracer, you can use it to instrument your code. This typically involves adding calls to the tracer API to create spans and annotate them with relevant data. Spans are units of work that are tracked by the tracer, and they can be used to represent everything from a single function call to a complex distributed operation.
    
4. Start and finish spans: When you want to start tracking a unit of work, you'll create a new span and start it. When the work is complete, you'll finish the span and add any relevant data to it. This might include data such as the start and end timestamps, the result of the operation, or any error messages that occurred.
    
5. Export the telemetry data: Once you've instrumented your application and generated telemetry data, you'll need to export it to a backend service for analysis. OpenTelemetry provides a variety of exporters that you can use to send the data to different observability tools, including Splunk, Prometheus, and Datadog.
    

### Using Splunk with OpenTelemetry:

Now that we've covered the basics of instrumenting your applications with OpenTelemetry, let's take a look at how you can use Splunk to analyze the telemetry data. Splunk is a powerful platform for analyzing, visualizing, and alerting on machine-generated data, including log files, metrics, and traces.

To use Splunk with OpenTelemetry, you'll need to install the Splunk exporter and configure it to send data to your Splunk instance. Here's a general overview of the steps involved:

1. Install the Splunk exporter: The first step is to install the Splunk exporter for OpenTelemetry. This exporter allows you to send telemetry data from your applications to Splunk for analysis.
    
2. Configure the exporter: Next, you'll need to configure the Splunk exporter with your Splunk instance details, such as the hostname and port number. You'll also need to specify the data you want to send to Splunk, such as traces, metrics, or logs.
    
3. Export the telemetry data: Once the exporter is configured, you can use it to export telemetry data from your applications to Splunk. The exporter will send the data to Splunk in real-time, allowing you to analyze and visualize it in near real-time.
    

### Analyzing and Visualizing Telemetry Data with Splunk:

Once you've configured the Splunk exporter and started exporting telemetry data from your applications, you can use Splunk to analyze and visualize the data. Splunk provides a variety of tools and features for analyzing and visualizing machine-generated data, including:

* Dashboards: Splunk provides a variety of dashboard widgets that you can use to visualize your telemetry data in real-time. These widgets include charts, tables, and maps, and you can customize them with different data sources and display options.
    
* Search and reporting: Splunk's search and reporting features allow you to search and filter your telemetry data in real-time. You can use Splunk's search syntax to specify the data you want to see, and then use the results to create reports and alerts.
    
* Alerting: Splunk's alerting features allow you to set up alerts based on your telemetry data. You can specify the conditions that trigger an alert, and then specify the actions to take when an alert is triggered. This might include sending an email, triggering a webhook, or generating a report.
    

To give you a more concrete understanding of how to use Splunk with OpenTelemetry, let's walk through an example using Python.

First, you'll need to install the OpenTelemetry Python library and the Splunk exporter. You can do this using pip:

```python
pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk splunk-opentelemetry-exporter
```

Next, you'll need to create a tracer and instrument your code with spans. Here's an example of how you might do this in a simple Python function:

```python
import opentelemetry.sdk.trace as trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my_function") as span:
        # Do some work here
        result = arg1 + arg2
        span.add_event("Calculation complete", { "result": result })
        return result
```

This code creates a tracer using the `get_tracer` function and then uses it to start a new span with the `start_as_current_span` method. The span is then finished when the `with` block ends, and an event is added to the span with the `add_event` method.

Now that you've instrumented your code with spans, you can use the Splunk exporter to send the telemetry data to Splunk. To do this, you'll need to configure the exporter with your Splunk instance details and specify the data you want to send. Here's an example of how you might do this in Python:

```python
import opentelemetry.exporter.splunk as splunk

# Create the Splunk exporter
exporter = splunk.SplunkExporter(
    host="splunk-host",
    port=8088,
    token="your-splunk-token",
)

# Configure the tracer to use the exporter
trace.tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    trace.SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter)
)
```

This code creates a Splunk exporter with the `SplunkExporter` class, and then adds it to the tracer as a span processor. This will cause the tracer to send all spans to Splunk as they are completed.

Once the exporter is configured, you can use it to send telemetry data to Splunk by calling the functions you instrumented with spans. For example:

```python
my_function(1, 2)
```

This will send the telemetry data for the `my_function` span to Splunk, where you can analyze and visualize it using the tools and features we discussed earlier.
